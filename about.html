    <h2>COVID-19 monitor</h2>
    <p>This dashboard visualises the week-on-week change in coronavirus cases in English local authorities. Further information about coronavirus can be found at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus" target="_blank">gov.uk/coronavirus</a></p>
    <h3>Notes on the data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Confirmed cases are recorded up to 9am on the day of publication.</li>
        <li>The date of confirmed cases refers to the <em>specimen</em> date not the <em>reporting</em> date.</li>
        <li>The number of <em>confirmed</em> cases is likely to be much lower than the <em>total</em> number of cases because some people are asymptomatic.</li>
        <li>Cases reported include those identified under pillar 1 (hospital) and pillar 2 (commercial labs and home tests) testing.</li>
        <li>There is a lag in the data shown because Public Health England <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/about-data" target="_blank">state</a> that the most recent cases are 'incomplete'.</li>
        <li>The data derives from Public Health England's <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk" target="_blank">Coronavirus Dashboard</a> and are  constantly being reviewed and corrected.</li>
        <li>Cases reported for Hackney are combined with the City of London and those for Cornwall are combined with the Isles of Scilly.</li>
        <li>The rate of cases is calculated by dividing the total number of cases by the <a href="https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/datasets/pestsyoala" target="_blank">mid-2020 estimate</a> of the resident population of each local authority multiplied by 100,000.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Interpreting the table</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The table  shows the weekly incidence rate for local authorities in England.</li>
        <li>Local authorities can be sorted by the lowest, highest, or weekly change in incidence rate.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Interpreting the chart</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The chart shows daily confirmed cases over time.</li>
        <li>The seven-day average is the average of a day and the three days of confirmed cases before and after it. It is centre aligned because the most recently reported cases are 'incomplete' and therefore likely to change.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Interpreting the map</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The size of the circles on the map are proportional to the number of confirmed cases reported in each Middle-layer Super Output Area (MSOA) during the latest 7 days of complete data. Each MSOA contains on average 7,200 residents. For more about MSOAs read this helpful <a href="http://www.statsmapsnpix.com/2020/10/hey-whats-msoa.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/undertheraedar" target="_blank">Alasdair Rae</a>.</li>
        <li>The position of the circle corresponds to the centroid or centre of the MSOA not the location of reported cases.</li>
    </ul>
